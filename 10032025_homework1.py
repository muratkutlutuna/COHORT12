# Write a short Python program that asks the user to enter

# print("This is the Fahrenheit format of the ",cels,"Celsius : ",fahr,"F",sep="")

# Task-2:
# Write a short Python program that asks the user to enter
# a distance (it can be a decimal number) in kilometers, 
# converts the entered distance into miles and prints the results.

# dist_km = float(input("Please enter the Distance in KM : "))
# dist_mile = dist_km*0.621371
