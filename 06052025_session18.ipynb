      "[216.64s - 220.39999999999998s] and transparency. Basically, client is\n",
      "[218.56s - 222.24s] going to be caching more tokens when\n",
      "[220.4s - 224.4s] using Gemini, saving you even more\n",
      "[222.24s - 226.16s] money. Another big change in this client\n",
      "[224.4s - 227.68s] update is that there's more flexibility\n",
      "[226.16s - 229.28s] with enhanced checkpoints. So, now\n",
      "[227.68s - 231.84s] they've added more checkpoints across\n",
      "[229.28s - 233.44s] the task workflows. So, you can reset at\n",
      "[231.84s - 235.28s] different points. Now, this one is\n",
      "[233.44s - 238.0s] interesting. You can now easily generate\n",
      "[235.28s - 239.76s] project standards with typing / new\n",
      "[238.0s - 242.64s] rule. So when you use this new command,\n",
      "[239.76s - 245.35999999999999s] it will cause client to generate a rule\n",
      "[242.64s - 247.83999999999997s] set such as a cursor rules file of your\n",
      "[245.36s - 249.76000000000002s] entire project all done autonomously by\n",

      "[258.32s - 263.36s] any AI model. So this is GP4.1 and by\n",
      "[260.88s - 265.84s] the way my startup vectal is number 17\n",
      "[263.36s - 268.0s] with 64 million tokens used in the last\n",
      "[265.84s - 270.0s] week. So yeah, client really is the most\n",
      "[268.0s - 271.92s] underrated AI code editor out there. All\n",
      "[270.0s - 274.4s] right, so let's go back into VS Code and\n",
      "[271.92s - 276.96000000000004s] on the top left, click on file, open\n",
      "[274.4s - 278.47999999999996s] folder, and select a folder where you\n",
      "[276.96s - 280.47999999999996s] want client to work in. So I just\n",
      "[278.48s - 282.56s] created an empty folder named code and\n",
      "[280.48s - 284.0s] let's open that. So first off, before\n",
      "[282.56s - 286.24s] you start with anything, make sure to\n",
      "[284.0s - 287.84s] switch into the plan mode. This is\n",
      "[286.24s - 289.6s] essential to maximize results with\n",
      "[287.84s - 292.23999999999995s] client because it will first create a\n",
      "[289.6s - 293.92s] clear plan for your project and then\n",
      "[292.24s - 296.0s] only once you both agree that this is a\n",
      "[293.92s - 297.68s] solid plan, it will start executing it.\n",
      "[296.0s - 299.2s] So let's click on plan. And to show you\n",
      "[297.68s - 301.52s] the power of client, I'm going to have\n",
      "[299.2s - 302.96s] it on one shot a game of chess. So\n",
      "[301.52s - 304.64s] here's my prompt. I want to build a\n",
      "[302.96s - 306.08s] simple game of chess. Create a plan for\n",
      "[304.64s - 307.84s] this. I want to do this in as little\n",
      "[306.08s - 309.2s] code as possible. Let's send that. Now,\n",
      "[307.84s - 310.96s] as you can see with client, you can\n",
      "[309.2s - 312.96s] easily see the amount of tokens coming\n",
      "[310.96s - 315.03999999999996s] in, coming out, as well as how much of\n",
      "[312.96s - 316.4s] the context window you're using based on\n",
      "[315.04s - 319.28000000000003s] the model. So, currently, we're using\n",
      "[316.4s - 321.03999999999996s] cloth 3.7 set, which has a 200,000 token\n",
      "[319.28s - 322.88s] context window. And we can easily see\n",
      "[321.04s - 325.44s] that the first prompt and the response\n",
      "[322.88s - 327.68s] filled out 12,000. This gives you so\n",
      "[325.44s - 329.2s] much like mental clarity about whether\n",
      "[327.68s - 330.64s] you should start a new chat or you know\n",
      "[329.2s - 332.47999999999996s] how much contacts you've provided in\n",
      "[330.64s - 335.44s] your current chat. And as a bonus, you\n",
      "[332.48s - 337.20000000000005s] can also see your API cost. So this is\n",
      "[335.44s - 339.76s] instantly a benefit of client over\n",
      "[337.2s - 341.59999999999997s] vinserve and cursor which don't really\n",
      "[339.76s - 343.2s] have so much transparency. Okay. So\n",
      "[341.6s - 344.72s] let's take a look at the response. As\n",
      "[343.2s - 346.96s] you can see it starts writing I need to\n",
      "[344.72s - 348.40000000000003s] create a plan. Since I'm in plan mode I\n",
      "[346.96s - 350.08s] should focus on gathering information\n",
      "[348.4s - 351.28s] asking questions. So it knows it's in\n",
      "[350.08s - 352.96s] plan mode. It cannot make changes. All\n",
      "[351.28s - 355.2s] right. So then it designed a simple\n",
      "[352.96s - 357.59999999999997s] implementation plan for the chess game.\n",
      "[355.2s - 360.24s] And it also created an architecture\n",
      "[357.6s - 362.40000000000003s] overview with a visual graph. Wow. I did\n",
      "[360.24s - 364.48s] not expect that. Okay. So, it outlines\n",
      "[362.4s - 366.71999999999997s] core components of the game, minimizing\n",
      "[364.48s - 369.04s] code, and creates a development phase.\n",
      "[366.72s - 371.28000000000003s] Not bad. Not bad at all. So, what we're\n",
      "[369.04s - 373.04s] going to do before switching to act is\n",
      "[371.28s - 374.79999999999995s] we're going to turn on yolo mode, also\n",
      "[373.04s - 376.88s] known as auto approve, by clicking this\n",
      "[374.8s - 379.12s] check box next to it. This opens up the\n",
      "[376.88s - 380.56s] menu for autoproof. And as it says, auto\n",
      "[379.12s - 382.24s] approveof allows client to perform the\n",
      "[380.56s - 384.32s] following actions without asking for\n",
      "[382.24s - 385.84000000000003s] permissions. So, it makes client even\n",
      "[384.32s - 387.44s] more autonomous. Now, obviously, there's\n",
      "[385.84s - 389.2s] some risk assigned with this. However,\n",
      "[387.44s - 391.36s] if you want to be a true vibe coder, you\n",
      "[389.2s - 393.28s] absolutely need to turn on every yolo\n",
      "[391.36s - 394.8s] mode or auto approveof that you see.\n",
      "[393.28s - 396.96s] Okay, so let's give it ability to read\n",
      "[394.8s - 398.64s] project files, edit project files,\n",
      "[396.96s - 400.23999999999995s] execute save commands, and if you're\n",
      "[398.64s - 402.4s] feeling a bit spicy, you can also do\n",
      "[400.24s - 403.92s] execute all commands. But for most of\n",
      "[402.4s - 406.23999999999995s] you, I wouldn't recommend you doing\n",
      "[403.92s - 408.8s] that. And definitely use the browser.\n",
      "[406.24s - 410.48s] Why not? And if you want to add MCP\n",
      "[408.8s - 411.84000000000003s] servers, you can also enable this. By\n",
      "[410.48s - 414.72s] the way, if you want me to make a video\n",
      "[411.84s - 416.56s] on how to add different MCP servers into\n",

      "[416.56s - 419.84s] and if enough people want it, I'll make\n",
      "[418.16s - 422.24s] that happen. And finally, you can also\n",
      "[419.84s - 425.28s] set the max amount of requests client\n",
      "[422.24s - 427.36s] can do autonomously before asking for\n",
      "[425.28s - 428.47999999999996s] approval. So, by default, it's 20. I\n",
      "[427.36s - 430.56s] would probably recommend doing something\n",
      "[428.48s - 432.40000000000003s] like 15, you know, 10 to 15. I think\n",
      "[430.56s - 433.6s] that's a sensible range. Okay. So, once\n",
      "[432.4s - 435.59999999999997s] you're happy with your settings, just\n",

      "   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n",
      " software and other kinds of works.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n",
      " to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n",
      " the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n",
      " share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n",
      " software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n",
      " GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n",
      " any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n",
      " your programs, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n",
      " price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n",
      " have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n",
      " them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n",
      " want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n",
      " free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n",
      " these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n",
      " certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n",
      " you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n",
      " gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n",
      " freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n",
      " or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n",
      " know their rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n",
      " (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n",
      " giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n",
      " that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n",
      " authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n",
      " changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n",
      " authors of previous versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n",
      " modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n",
      " can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n",
      " protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n",
      " pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n",
      " use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n",
      " have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n",
      " products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n",
      " stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n",
      " of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n",
      " States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n",
      " software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n",
      " avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n",
      " make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n",

      "   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n",

      " exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n",
      " earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n",
      "\n",
      "   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n",

      "   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n",
      " permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n",
      " infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n",

      " Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n",

      " \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n",
      " (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n",

      " which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n",
